## 3. Gameplay

Similar to a tycoon game like gameGev tycoon, the objective is to make successfull memes to make money.  You gotta pay bills based on where you live.  In the start, you are in a dungeon with low rent and utility.  I want to be able to allow users to add characters and maybe move around, but let's get the simulation part solved first.
